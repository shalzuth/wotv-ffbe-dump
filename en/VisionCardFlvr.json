One reason for this is Mont's overt kindness and oft-mocked method of selecting soldiers. While the division's commander, Lilyth, is a skilled warrior known as the Blaze of the Battlefield, both the overproud Baelo and archer Learte are Mont's childhood playmates. Factoring in Ramada—part tactician, part astrologer—there are many who decry the main members' paltry wartime experience. Yet rather than hold the front lines, «Caelum» acts as an adaptive unit. Where the members lack in fighting power, they make up for in their individual talents, and their bonds of friendship are rock-solid."

Leonis's ability to remain steadfast while surrounded by larger territories is due in no small part to Owe's countless military exploits. It was thus an easy choice for King Oelde to appoint him as the princes' sword instructor. The princes were polar opposites in both personality and swordsmanship, and Owe saw more of his past self in Sterne—a young man overeager to demonstrate his father's gallantry. He saw great talent slumbering in Mont as well, but he knew that only Mont himself could draw it out. Sterne is both motivated and astute, and he masters Owe's techniques with the same precision that Owe himself had. Though Owe saw Sterne's overly rapid growth causing rifts among the royal family, he turned a blind eye and chose instead to love Sterne as his disciple."

The offer of marriage was suggested by Sadali, the founder of the Church of the Crystal, as a way of urging Hourne to ally with Fennes against the encroaching threat of Rundall to the west. As part of this arrangement, Muraga's daughter Vinera would wed Prince Dario, and Machérie would wed into Fennes. Though Robb rejected the idea at first, Machérie's own insistence that it would be \"for the sake of protecting Hourne\" swayed him. In truth, Robb never believed the necklace would leave the kingdom except for in times of war. Given that he entrusted it to his daughter, one can appreciate how deep his love for his daughter runs."
