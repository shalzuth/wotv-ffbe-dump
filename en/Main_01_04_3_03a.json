      "value": "This Sadali guy is our ally, isn't he?"
    },

      "key": "010",
      "value": "For now. He mediated the alliance between Hourne and Fennes; it would never have been achieved otherwise."

    },
    {
      "key": "016",
      "value": "Perhaps he's planning to attack Rundall after consolidating all that power."

      "value": "Or...we could keep a close watch on Sadali."
    },

      "value": "There's no mistaking that Muraga is Sadali's pawn."
    },

      "key": "024",
      "value": "Basically, keeping watch on Sadali might give us a clue about what Muraga's up to?"

      "key": "027",
      "value": "Why?"
    },
    {
      "key": "028",
      "value": "The fastest way to defeat an enemy is to go for the head, right? If it comes to that, of course."
    },
    {
      "key": "029",
      "value": "Great minds think alike, I see."
    },

      "value": "I wouldn't go that far."
    },

      "key": "033",
      "value": "Sir, if I may. It appears some monsters nearby have become aware of our presence."
    },
    {
      "key": "034",
      "value": "Then we must exterminate them discreetly, so as not to draw attention from Sadali."
    },

      "key": "035",
      "value": "...And then?"
    },

      "value": "We observe Sadali's movements from a distance."
    },

      "key": "037",
      "value": "And if worse comes to worst...I get to kill him, right?"
    },

      "value": "If worse comes to worst, yes."
    },
